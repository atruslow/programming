        We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

        I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

        Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

        You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

        -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
        1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
        0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
        Return the number that I picked.
